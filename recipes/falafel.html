    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Listen, there were a lot of glorious, fulfilling days in culinary school, but perhaps one of the most rewarding classes was the falafel lesson. There are few academic experiences that you can say ended with pita pockets stuffed to the brim with crispy falafel balls, but this was one of them, and I reflect upon it very fondly.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest realizations from this day was that making crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside, packed-with-flavor falafel is not that hard, nor does it require any specialty ingredients. Since school, I've made these plenty of times for small get togethers (well, pre-Covid, at least). Who would ever turn down an invitation to a falafel party? If you're ready to start whipping up a batch of your own, here's how it's done.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.</li>
        <li>Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until mixture is finely ground and holds together when pressed. Transfer garbanzo mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with moistened hands into a ball.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    </ol>
